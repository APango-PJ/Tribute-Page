                Verghese Kurien, (born November 26, 1921, Kozhikode, Kerala state, 
                India—died September 9, 2012, Nadiad, Gujarat state), Indian 
                engineer and entrepreneur who was regarded as the architect of 
                India’s “white revolution,” which transformed the country from an 
                importer of dairy products to the world’s largest milk producer 
                through a system of farmer cooperatives.
                <br><br>
                Kurien was born into a wealthy Syrian Christian family. He attended 
                Loyola College of the University of Madras (B.Sc., 1940), and he 
                earned another bachelor’s degree, in mechanical engineering, from
                the same university in 1943. He also studied engineering at the
                Tata Iron and Steel Company in Jamshedpur, then in Bihar state,
                and he undertook training in dairy engineering at the National
                Dairy Research Institute of Bangalore (now Bengaluru).
                Kurien received a government scholarship to study at Michigan
                State University, where he received (1948) a master’s degree in 
                mechanical engineering. When he returned to India, he was required,
                as a condition of the scholarship, to work at the Government 
                Research Creamery in Anand, Gujarat state, which he began doing in 
                1949.

                At the time, a small cooperative of dairy farmers, the Kaira 
                District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union, was working to 
                overcome an entrenched system in which small local dairies sold 
                milk to a large supplier for very little money, and the supplier 
                transported the milk to Bombay (now Mumbai) and sold it at a
                substantial profit. The cooperative’s chairman, Sri Tribhuvandas 
                Patel, asked Kurien to help strengthen the organization. Kurien 
                became manager of the cooperative (which later came to be called 
                Amul and became one of the largest food producers in India). 
                Under his leadership, the organization acquired equipment to 
                process and store dairy products and proved to be a reliable 
                supplier. In the process, it improved the lives of the rural 
                dairy farmers. Other dairy cooperatives were formed on a similar 
                model, and in 1965 Kurien became the first chairman of the new 
                National Dairy Development Board. He instituted Operation Flood, 
                also known as the “white revolution,” a long-range program with 
                the objective of increasing milk production while both augmenting 
                rural incomes and keeping prices within reach for consumers 
                through the expansion of the cooperative movement. In addition, 
                he established (1973) the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing 
                Federation. Gurien received numerous honours, chief among them 
                the Ramon Magsaysay Award for community leadership (1963) and the 
                World Food Prize (1989).
